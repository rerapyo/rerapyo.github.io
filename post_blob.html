          Blob: My first game jam and how I learned valuable lessons

      <h2>CONTEXT</h2>
      <p>
        BLOB is a platform game made on my first Game Jam. I worked as a game
        producer and level designer for the game. It was a 24h Game Jam for
        women only.
      </p>
      <h2>PROCESS</h2>
      <p>
        The theme of the Jam was "TO BE VS TO BECOME". We had 8h a day to make
        it work and very few people that had participated in Jams before or that
        worked with games.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first thing we did was to brainstorm as many game ideas as we could,
        deciding to split the groups later according to the game that appealed
        the most to each of us. This is the
        <b>first lesson</b>
        I learned, it is way harder to narrow down ideas in a group of ten than
        it is on a group of three or five people.
        <b>Smaller groups work faster.</b>
      </p>

      <p>
        By the end of the first 8h, we had the whole game planned. We thought
        about the mechanics, the art, which colors we wanted to use, how many
        levels it would have, all the cutscenes, what experiences we wanted to
        create and an ending for our formless being. We created a trello for the
        group with all the tasks that were necessary and split everything with
        the members. When we felt that things were organized enough we went
        home.
      </p>
      <p>
        The game is about a formless being called BLOB. The background was
        supposed to be black and white and BLOB's color would change according
        to his mood. The main idea and experience that we wanted to present were
        that even though things might be difficult for you and you will struggle
        to overcome them, you will surpass the challenges and accept who you
        are.
      </p>

      <p>
        We arrived on the morning of the 2nd day and started producing. That was
        the moment when I learned the <b>second lesson</b>.
        <b
          >Get to know and understand the strengths and weakness of your team
          members</b
        >
        so that the things you plan on creating, can actually be made. Planning
        is good, but keeping your ideas doable is more important.
      </p>

      <p>
        I planned three levels for the game. Each to be played easily by a
        geometrical figure first, and later by BLOB. Initially, we planned on
        making them playable by the geometrical figures and after by BLOB. I
        finished the designs and started making a GDD. At the end of day 2 and
        the beginning of day 3 I learned the
        <b>third lesson: you got to keep the scope within reason.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        We started making cuts so that things would be finished on time. First
        cut to fit the scope was: we will make a cutscene instead of a level
        playable by different figures. Second cut: no cutscenes in between
        levels, let's present everything at the beginning of the game. Third
        cut: no cutscene at all. Just turn the idea into a diagram and hope
        players will understand.
      </p>

      </div>
      <p>
        By the end of the time we had to finish the jam almost all the group
        were waiting anxiously while the programmer finished the last things and
        started building a version that could be published on itch.io. We did
        not playtest the game. This was lesson four.
        <b>Playtest your game whenever possible</b>, so that you can keep bugs
        from growing and can find weird corner cases.

        At the end of the weekend I had my first game ever published. I had a
        lot of fun, met wonderful women that I cherish a lot and learned
        valuable lessons:
