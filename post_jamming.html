      <h2>CONTEXT</h2>
      <p>
        Jamming Dilemma was made during Ludum Dare 43. I and my team did not
        have as much time to spend on the process as in previous jams. And we
        were all working remotely. For this jam, I worked as a producer and game
        designer.
      </p>
      <h2>PROCESS</h2>
      <p>
        We were very excited to take part in Ludum Dare, it was our first global
        jam and we wanted to see what people would come up with. Also, almost
        all the themes were fantastic and we had been following the
        announcements talking about ideas we had for them.
      </p>
      <p>
        The theme was announced, and it was our least favorite one.
        <b>Sacrifices Must Be Made</b>. At this point, we almost bailed out of
        the jam. One of my roles as a producer was to keep the team motivated.
        So we talked and decided that since we weren't as excited about the
        theme that we were gonna keep things simple.
      </p>
      <div class="third">
        <img src="post_jamming_2.png" />

        <img src="post_jamming_4.png" />
      </div>
      <p>
        We started brainstorming some simple ideas about sacrifices, but many of
        them were dark and we weren't quite satisfied. I came up with the idea
        of sacrificing ideas because, in the end, that was what the jam was
        making us do. I was told that it could be considered a petty choice by
        other LD participants, but I told them that it was a protest art and
        that there was nothing wrong about protesting and having fun while doing
        something.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before going to rest we organized the tasks and what we were going to do
        throughout the weekend. I decided to try a new style of spreadsheet,
        with all the tasks in a single sheet and with priority status. So that
        we could work on major issues first and implement minor ones later.
      </p>

      <p>
        As a game designer, I had only one task at hand: to write short game
        ideas for some of the themes that were opted out of the jam. I wrote
        ideas for: Break the cycle; Control the environment, not the player;
        Everything grows; Darkness is your friend; Making connections; One item,
        many uses; Two connected worlds and It only changes when you aren't
        looking. There were other themes being voted, but those were our
        favorites.
      </p>

      <p>
        I had to learn a lesson the tough way when writing those ideas down. I
        tried to keep everything under 150 characters because I honestly thought
        that a tweet was a good size to sum up a concept. The thing is... I
        wrote everything and when the developer tried to add a concept to the
        cards it did not fit.
      </p>
      <p>
        I forgot to prototype and because of that, I had to get back to the
        paper and write everything again using only a third of the characters.
        Which turned out to be a good exercise, learning how to sum a whole
        concept up in only 50 characters was quite challenging, but nonetheless
        fun!
      </p>

      <h2>Final Outcome</h2>

      <p>
        As a game designer working in this game was great to develop my skill of
        letting go of ideas. In the past, I've had a tough time giving up on
        things I believed were good for projects I worked at. Now I can do it
        without suffering because I understand that better ideas might come up
        when I do that.
      </p>
      <p>
        I published my third game at the end of LD43, the Jamming Dilemma. I and
        my team managed to do and add almost everything that we wanted to the
        game while having a lot of fun and without stressing out because that
        was one of our goals. In the end, the LD community enjoyed our take on
        the theme and voted us high in the humor category. We got 255th out of
        nearly 2.500 games that were submitted.
