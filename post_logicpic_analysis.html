          Logic Pic: Improving onboarding and content consumption rates

      <h2>CONTEXT</h2>
      <p>
        Logic Pic is a nonogram puzzle, where you have to paint tiles in order
        to fill out grids and discover pixel art. I work as a System Game
        Designer for the game.
      </p>
      <h2>BRIEF</h2>
      <p>
        Many players were reaching the end of the game and not really consuming
        all of the content being presented to them. I was asked to work with the
        level progression and increase the consumption rates, without causing a
        downfall in retention.
      </p>
      <h2>PROCESS</h2>
      <p>
        At first, I decided to take a look at the game as a whole and understand
        its features. How everything was connected in a systematic way. Things
        didn't look so good and I made a hypothesis that one of our monetization
        problems came from the fact that the only thing that we sold, hints,
        were not mandatory to use and that players could just skip the levels
        they considered to be too hard.
      </p>

      <p>
        Afterwards, I went on to analyze the data we had for the game as a way
        to search for some answers and see what I could find. I checked how many
        players were reaching each level, and especially how were the win and
        churn rate for those levels. Levels that had high churn rates, had lower
        win rates but didn't represent a decrease in retention, which proved the
        point mentioned before. That the players were just skipping the hard
        levels and playing the easier ones.
      </p>

      <p>
        With this in mind, I decided to look at some other metrics, such as the
        average and median time spent on levels; hints used per level; solver
        (our difficulty measurement tool); grid size and such. I was searching
        for the strongest correlation to base the new level progression of the
        game on.
      </p>
      <p>
        I wanted to create a learning experience at the beginning of the game so
        that players would keep the game regardless of the levels being a little
        harder. I was also looking to get a sort of sine wave for the difficulty
        of the levels throughout the themed based packs.
      </p>

      <p>
        Once I checked all the correlations I decided to go with one based on
        the time, and the solver. Since players were gonna have to play
        level-by-level I thought it wouldn't be a good experience to face two
        lengthy levels one after the other. I removed some of the levels in the
        game because they had outliers metrics that would hurt the player
        experience and might affect retention negatively.
      </p>

      <h2>Final Outcome</h2>

      <p>
        We did an AB test to check some possibilities and decided to implement a
        full linear progression on the game, in which the players have to beat
        the previous level in order to unlock the next one. This lead to an
        increase in revenue of nearly 10%, since now players weren't skipping
        the hard levels and were actually using hints to beat them.
