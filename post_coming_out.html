      <h2>CONTEXT</h2>
      <p>
        Coming Out Simulator is a game developed at Women Game Jam Brazil. I
        worked as a game producer, game designer and helped with some of the
        programming during the creation of the game.
      </p>
      <h2>PROCESS</h2>
      <p>
        At WGJBR-São Paulo there were some international visitors. They were
        girls from all over Latin America for an event called Girl Games. Some
        of them presented pitches and invited whoever wanted to work with them
        to do so. I decided I wanted to take the challenge and worked on a group
        with an artist from Argentina and a programmer from Salvador.
      </p>
      <p>
        The theme of the Jam was "LOSE TO WIN" and her idea was a Coming Out
        Simulator. The main challenge was adapting everything to work together
        and to transmit the experience of coming out of the closet. Which is a
        quite difficult and sometimes hurtful experience, but that can show you
        new comforts.
      </p>
      <p>
        We started brainstorming how we wanted our game to be and how we would
        connect everything. That’s when I had the insight of losing fears and
        prejudices to win who you are. Because in the end, getting out of the
        closet is all about overcoming your fears and other people prejudices so
        that you will be able to be who you are. It is also about understanding
        that you can find little comforts everywhere.
      </p>

      <p>
        First, we thought about making a closet where you had to find objects
        and read what the fear/prejudice/comfort about them was. Then we
        realized this was too easy and wouldn’t translate the experience and
        toughness of the task at hand correctly.
      </p>
      <p>
        We listed a bunch of prejudices we knew people had, also many fears that
        we had faced. We chose to do some puzzles, two fears, and two
        prejudices. I knew what we wanted to was bold in terms of scope, so I
        tried to keep everything as organized as possible so that everyone could
        accomplish their tasks easily. We listed all the assets that would be
        necessary for each puzzle and I decided to approach a new method of
        organizing tasks, I used a spreadsheet with tabs for each role at the
        game:

      <p>
        At first, we were going to do two simple puzzles. It was going to be a
        mechanic for fear and another for prejudice, but we decided we wanted to
        diversify and level up a bit. Doing four different mechanics:
      </p>

      <p>
        We decided to use a two piece necklace to translate the fear that LGBTQ+
        people end up alone and we used a memory puzzle to show that you don’t
        need to find an exact match. The match to a shoe is a sock. To a discman
        is an earphone and that people already have full hearts.
      </p>

      <p>
        We used an album to translate the fear that LGBTQ+ people might lose
        their family and friends when getting out. We used a sliding puzzle for
        that, because things might not always fit and might be messy, but after
        moving the pieces around you will get comfortable again and if needed
        find new friends.
      </p>

      <img src="post_coming_out_6.png" />
      <p>
        We used a circular puzzle to talk about the prejudice that being an
        LGBTQ+ is just a phase and it will pass. We choose to use the moon
        because it has many phases, but it always comes back to the same place
        and form.
      </p>

      <img src="post_coming_out_7.png" />
      <p>
        The last prejudice we decided to address was the one that all LGBTQ+ are
        promiscuous. We used a fluffy handcuff for it and planned on doing a
        pipe puzzle into the key. The idea behind it was that you could find
        your way out and accept yourself and sexual preferences by exploring the
        ways around. We couldn't implement it on time for the jam.
      </p>

      <p>
        Apart from those objects that represented the fears and prejudices the
        player had to overcome we also added a bunch of objects that represented
        comforts to help the player understand that even though things were
        difficult there were also good things to be discovered outside the
        closet. The game can only be completed by finding all the objects and
        getting comfortable with who you are. We developed two different endings
        that might appear depending on the players last choice to open the door
        to the world.
      </p>

      <h2>Final Outcome</h2>

      <p>
        After the Jam I and my team decided to do an intro to the game and
        translate it to our mother languages and not only English because we
        were really proud of what we had accomplished and we wanted to turn the
        game accessible for as many people as possible. Now Coming Out Simulator
        can be played in English, Portuguese and Spanish.
