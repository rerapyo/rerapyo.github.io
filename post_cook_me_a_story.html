      <h2>CONTEXT</h2>
      <p>
        Cook me a Story was developed during GGJ19, at Global Game Jam - Sede
        Inclusiva, São Paulo. It is a narrative, LGBTQ+ inclusive game.
      </p>
      <h2>PROCESS</h2>
      <p>
        At the beginning of 2019 I got myself a challenge... To organize a game
        jam for the first time, it didn't take long to realize that I was not
        capable of doing it alone. Specially while working full time and also
        wanting to participate in it.
      </p>
      <p>
        I passed on the task to two extremely talented women I met earlier at
        Women Game Jam Brazil and became a supporter and no longer an organizer.
        I helped arrange some sponsors and gifts for the participants so that I
        could focus on creating a game and not in the organization of the event
        itself.
      </p>

      <p>
        Global Game Jam’s 2019 theme was "What home means to you". With such a
        subjective theme to work it was hard for I and my team to figure out
        what we really wanted to do as a game. We brainstormed a bunch of ideas,
        over 40 of them, and still couldn't get everyone quite satisfied.

        We decided to do a game about food, because for many of us home is a
        specific taste, and not only that, food can trigger emotions and
        memories, transporting you back home. Cook me a story is a narrative
        game, in which the main character tell you bits of story, while giving
        you tips of what to cook so that you can unlock the rest of the story.
        We wanted to make three different stories, with an entrance, a main dish
        and a dessert for each of them.
      </p>

      <p>
        We splitted the tasks and I was responsible for creating a tag system
        that would identify which ingredients were necessary to satisfy the
        hints being given by the characters. Another game designer in the team
        was responsible for prototyping the idea and testing it with other
        participants to see if the flow of the game was clear.

      <p>
        Since we wanted to use animals and not people in our game, we used foods
        that were edible by animals. First I wrote the ten ingredients in a
        spreadsheet and their characteristics, so that I could start
        cross-referencing them. I wanted each characteristic to belong to at
        least two ingredients, and every ingredient should have at least two
        characteristics. The idea was to have a well balanced system.
      </p>

      <p>
        An important thing about our game is that it truly speaks from our
        hearts. We had a trans woman as a programmer in our team and we wanted
        to gift her with a story that would make her feel safe and accepted.
        That's what we focused in doing in terms of narrative. When she first
        read the story to input it into the engine she nearly cried of
        happiness, which made us feel very happy about what we created in terms
        of experience.

      <p>
        My main lesson while creating Cook me a Story was that tag systems don't
        always work perfectly because people's perception of what is crunchy,
        nutritious and salty varies according to their personal context. And
        that I shouldn't stick as much to the numbers to create a perfect
        system, but pay more attention to the experience and perception of what
        might belong where generally speaking. It's OK for leaves to have
        several characteristics.
      </p>
      <p>
        And also, that it is great to create games with people you love and feel
        safe around ♥️
